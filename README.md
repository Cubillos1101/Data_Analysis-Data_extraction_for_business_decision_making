## **Introduction**
We will explore the different databases of a fictitious company (Northwind database), which seeks to make the decision of paying a bonus to the employees who have made the 5 highest sales.

## **Task 1 : Project and Database Introduction**
**Objective:** Explore different databases to understand their structure, including the columns and the type of information they contain.

**Key Takeaways**
- A database is a collection of related tables.
- Data is stored in tables and is organized into rows and columns.
- The W3Schools SQL Tryit Editor provides a place to write and run SQL code. 

Here is our database overview:

```
SELECT *
FROM Customers;

SELECT *
FROM Categories;

SELECT *
FROM Employees;

...
```

# **Task 2 : A Look at the Question and the Suggested Solution**
**Objective:** Identify the structure of different databases and, based on the question to be answered, select the most relevant databases to obtain accurate insights.  
**Business Problem:**  As a method of increasing future sales, the company has decided to give employee bonuses for exemplary performance in sales. Bonuses will be awarded to those employees who are responsible for the five highest order amounts.  
- <ins>**How can we identify those employees?**<ins>

**Key Takeaways**
- The data analyst strives to use data to answer business questions.
- A business problem is best solved by examining the data available and visualizing which pieces of data should make up the solution.
- Data from multiple tables may be required to solve a business problem.

We are going to use 4 tables in order to solve our business problem: Employees, Orders, Order Details and  Products.

Values must sometimes be calculated:  
    <ins> Sales amount per item = Quantity multiplied by Unit Price </ins>
```
SELECT *
FROM Orders;

SELECT *
FROM Orderdetails
ORDER BY OrderId;

SELECT *
FROM Products;
```

## **Task 3 : Joining Tables Together in SQL to Obtain Data for Analysis**
**Objective:** Retrieve the necessary data to answer a business question by joining relevant fields from multiple tables using SQL.

**Key Takeaways**
- To join two tables, they must share a common column.
- The SQL INNER JOIN command returns only rows that match between two tables.
- An SQL query can be keyed into the SQL Tryit editor without regard to case; however, correct spelling and punctuation is critical

To achieve this, we will use the following fields found in different data tables, as shown in the diagram below
| Tables | Fields |
| ------- | ---------|
| Employees | LastName and FirstName |
| Orders | OrderID |
| OrderDetails | ProductID and Quantity |
| Products | Price |
> [!TIP]
>**Reminder:** Tables must have a common field to establish relationships between them.

```
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Orders.OrderID, Products.ProductID,
            Quantity, Price
FROM (((Employees
  INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID)
  INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID)
  INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID)
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;

```

## **Task 4 : Calculate and Summarize Sales for each Order**
**Objective:**  Write SQL code to calculate and aggregate data by determining the total sales value per order. This involves multiplying quantity by price for each line item and then summarizing the results to obtain the overall order total.

**Key Takeaways**
- New, temporary fields can be created as a result of a calculation in SQL.
- Aggregating or grouping data can make it more useful for decision making.
- In SQL code, the SUM() function, together with the GROUP BY clause, can be used to aggregate data.

**1.** Calculate Quantity * Price for each line item on the order.
```
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Orders.OrderID, Products.ProductID,
        	Quantity, Price, Quantity * Price as SalesAmount
FROM (((Employees
  INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID)
  INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID)
  INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID)
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;
```

**2.** Add together (summarize) the line item totals to get one total sales value per order.

```
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Orders.OrderID, SUM(Quantity * Price) as SalesAmount
FROM (((Employees
  INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID)
  INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID)
  INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID)
GROUP BY LastName, FirstName,Orders.OrderID;
```
